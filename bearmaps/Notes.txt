Consider the following input for Rasterer:

ullon = -122.241632
lrlon = -122.24053
ullat = 37.87655
lrlat = 37.87548
w = 892.0
h = 875.0

To find the distance displayed per pixel using the given longitude range (longDPP):

|ullon - lrlon| = netLon = 0.00110199999 // in degrees longitude

S_lon = 288,200
// this is a unit of feet per degree longitude,
// at a given latitude
// helper methods getSLon() and getSLat calculate this

netLon x S_lon = viewingWidth = 317 feet

viewingWidth / w = lonDPP = 0.355 feet per pixel

* Repeat with latitude range, use the smallest dpp of the two

To find RESOLUTION that we should display:

1. Calculate the lonDPP and latDPP of d1, which has the following coordinates in
its upper left corner : (-122.2558, 37.89219) and the following coordinates in
lower right corner: (-122.21191, 37.85749)

lonDPP would be calculated as:

|-122.2558 - (-122.21191)| = netLon

netLon x S_lon = viewingWidth

viewingWidth / w = lonDPP_d1

2. Use the following formula to find which resolution matches the lonDPP for a
given query. Iterate over D[2, 9] until (resolution < givenDPP)

resolution = lonDPP_d1 / (2^(D - 1))

--- HELPER METHODS ---

getSLon(double latitude)
    - calculates the feet per degree longitude at a given latitude

getSLat(double longitude)
    - calculates the feet per degree latitude at a given longitude

--- Notes on RASTERRESULTPARAMS Object ---

public final String[][] renderGrid
    - 2D array of dN_xi_yj, where N is depth from 1-7

public final double rasterUlLon, rasterUlLat, rasterLrLon, rasterLrLat
    - latitudes and longitudes of upper left and lower right corners of the
    map area with chosen depth; these are different from the ones the user passes in
    because these are calculated by our program

public final int depth

public final boolean querySuccess
