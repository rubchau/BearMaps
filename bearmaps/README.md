BearMaps is a web application that uses location data from the OpenStreetMap project to provide users with map functionality, similar to Google Maps, in the city of Berkeley. An undirected, weighted graph is used to model location data and a k-d tree is built on top of this graph to enable quick route and location search. This project was completed through UC Berkeley's Data Structures course, CS61B, by Ruby Chauhan and Jacky Chow.
